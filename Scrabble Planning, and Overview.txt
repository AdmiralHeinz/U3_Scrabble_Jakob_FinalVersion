planning:

steps
-read the webpage
-create txt file
-read a line of the text file
-check word
-add word to list

reasoning
-used list instead of array because list is not a set length
-checked for unallowed letters because there are more of them and the word will be either approved or discarded more quickly


methods:

-read file void
-check word bool
release notes:

Known Bugs:
-does not account for duplicate letters in the word
-does not account for blank tiles
